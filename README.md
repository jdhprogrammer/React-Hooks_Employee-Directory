Employee or User Directory built as full MERN application. 
MongoDB, Express, React, Node. Basically a Table of Employees/Users. 
You can search by name and filter the employees. 
You can Sort by Name, Phone number, Email, and Date of Birth. 
You can click the Email button to see a "toast pop-up" with the email. 
You can Click on Employee name to see a detail page with a few more details for that employee.
```

#### User Story

employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
